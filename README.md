Step 1: Write a sentence down.
Step 2: Visualize audibly as the Stanley Parable voice to see if it’s gentle enough.

Use the voice of the computer.

You start as an actual little dot. It expands with every move. Does it expand? Or does it just adjust to the choices you make. There are two ways. 

The beginning of a little Earth.

More motivational.

“You can become [[greedy]] or follow the path of [[modesty]] to the bones”
You can [[fly]] and you can [[fall]] to the ground just as easily. Just as easily.

With every breathe it takes 

It seems there is no other place than the one filled with [[boundaries|Intro2]].

Despite that a state in which boundaries do not exist is [[possible|Intro3]].

This is a dot of plentiful [[forests|1.1]]. Or perhaps a fortuitous and sprawling [[mountains|1.2]]? Or who knows... [[snow|1.3]]-ridden landscapes of a frozen world.

If something makes you stop trying, break through that and [try]. And [try]. And try [again]. If you [not try]...

Age of Aquarius as the ending of the game. Light envelops the little dot.
Ascension, enlightenment, transformation (of the human race).

Voice over / rubaszny głęboki przyjemny głos
When the voice says it choices appear floating next to or around the little dot.
